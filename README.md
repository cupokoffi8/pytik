# PyTik
This code implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game using the Streamlit library. It allows two players to play the game on the web interface. 
The game board is displayed using buttons, and the game logic is implemented in Python.

## Installation
This code requires the following dependencies:

 - Streamlit: can be installed using pip install streamlit

## Usage
To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:
`streamlit run game.py`
Then, the game will be launched in a new browser tab.

## How to Play
 - The game requires two players. Player 1 will be "X" and player 2 will be "O".
 - Click on an empty button to place your symbol on the board.
 - The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal; or when all of the buttons are filled without any winner.
 - If the game ends, a message will be displayed showing the winner or that the game was a tie.
